# Replace_it
 
Hello! This is a python script that acts like a find and replace function in a text editor, but stands alone. It uses the Easy GUI module because that's less lines that Tkinter and I didn't see a need for a complicated GUI. 

For easy use, use autohotkey's run command to launch this script with a custom keybind. I like Ctrl + Shift + H.
